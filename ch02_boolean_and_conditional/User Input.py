#Take userinput
#use input() to take user input and store in a variable
#Rememeber spacing, much prefer to have a seperate print line
## ex: print "What is your name"
## ex: data = input()
print("What is your name sir?")

user_input= input()

#Or having it in line, just dont forget the spacing
#data = input("What is your name? ")


print ("So your name is " + user_input)
