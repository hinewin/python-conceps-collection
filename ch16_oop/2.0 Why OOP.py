# Why OOP?
#- The goal is to ENCAPSULATE code into logical,hierarchical grouping
#using classes to reason code in a higher level

#Private vs Public method
# Private (inside a given class) _cards (inside the class DECK)

#Encapsulation- grouping of public & private attributes and methods
# into a programmatic class, making abstraction possible

#Abstraction- Exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface
#- hide private attributes & methods (inner workings) from users
